**The motivation for this project:**

* This project aims to look at the effect of sociodemographic indicators on mental health among a cohort of Irish residents aged 50+ yrs.

**The anticipated data sources:**

* The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) Waves 1, 2, and 3
* https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/726

**The intended final products:** 

* Descriptive statistics in the form of tables and plots that provide information on our project objective
* Final products include: report and webpage with screencast

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**

Planned Analyses / Visualizations:

* ICD-10: bar graph of proportions of each ICD-10 code to determine which ICD-10 diagnosis accounts for the greatest burden of disease in our population. We can potentially facet by sex to see if the burden is different for males and females. 
* Loneliness: spaghetti plot of loneliness over time for males who were widowed at baseline.
* Physical & Mental/Emotional Health: hexagonal heatmap of self-rated physical health vs.  mental/emotional health among all individuals in Wave 3.
* Quality of Life: density plots of the distribution of total scores on the CASP-19 by age group in Wave 2. 

Coding challenges: 

* Combining data from multiple waves with different variable names
