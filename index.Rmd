Overview:
</b>
</center>
Quality of Life is the standard of health and happiness that an individual experiences throughout their lifetime. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, quality of life is a multidimensional public health topic that assesses factors of physical health, mental health, and sociodemographic predictors. Rather than studying rates of morbidity or mortality our motivation for this project was to use our contextual and technical knowledge in epidemiology and biostatistics to study indicators and outcomes that are a proxy for the measure of quality of life among an Irish cohort.

This project is a broad examination of the implications of aging on physical and mental health. The inspiration for this analysis was drawn from the group members research interests including depression, aging, and chronic diseases. The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/aging-depression.aspx ) was used as a reference for the variables we chose to analyze.

Discussion & Conclusions:
</b>
</center>
The results from our study indicate that there are sociodemographic variations in quality of life measures: mental health, physical health, and loneliness as well as the prevalence of disease. 
<br>
<br>
&emsp; 1. Those who felt they had better physical health also had better mental health and vice versa. We also found a larger concentration of older adults reporting "Very Good" or "Good" physical and mental health. This trend remained consistent across sex and over time. Unfortunately, this means that there was minimal improvement in physical and mental health, but also minimal decline in physical and mental health. Since our graph depicted a correlation between mental health and physical health we anticipated an association. Our null hypothesis was that there is no association between mental health and physical health and the alternate hypothesis was that there is an association between mental health and physical health. We set alpha to 0.05 and calculated the chi-squared test statistic (4078.8) and p-value (0), which was significant. At the 5% level of significance, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between mental health and physical health, which matches graph 1.
<br>
&emsp; &emsp; a. We used shiny to further stratify the analysis. At the 5% level of significance, among married females in wave 1, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between mental health and physical health.
<br>
&emsp; &emsp; b. At the 5% level of significance, among married males in wave 2, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between mental health and physical health.
<br>
&emsp; &emsp; c. At the 5% level of significance, among married females in wave 2, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between mental health and physical health.
<br>
&emsp; &emsp; d. At the 5% level of significance, among married males in wave 3, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between mental health and physical health.
<br>
&emsp; &emsp; e. At the 5% level of significance, among married females in wave 3, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between mental health and physical health.
<br>
<br>
&emsp; 2. We expected that loneliness would increase over time for widowed men more than widowed women. According to graph 2 we found this to be true. For widowed men, those with a loneliness of 2 or higher seemed to decrease their loneliness across waves and those with a loneliness of 1 seemed to increase their loneliness across waves. As we expected, widowed women stayed at relatively the same loneliness level across all waves with the exception of an an outlier at level 8 loneliness. In contrast, married men seemed to decrease in loneliness at every baseline point, while women stayed relatively the same from wave 1 to wave 3.
<br>
<br>
&emsp; 3. Our hypothesis for this plot was more broad in that we expected the proportion of people with chronic diseases to be higher, simply because the cohort is older and in Ireland, which may not have a high prevalence of infectious, or perinatal diseases and conditions. The bar graph specified that the 4 diseases with the highest proportion were circulatory system diseases, eye diseases, nutritional/metabolic diseases, and musculoskeletal system diseases. As predicted there were no incident cases of infectious diseases or perinatal conditions. Additionally, there were no cases of congenital malformations, ear diseases, or skin conditions. Interestingly, across sex, we noticed that the most prevalent disease among men was circulatory system diseases but among women it was nutritional/metabolic diseases.
