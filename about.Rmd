This project was developed using data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). TILDA  is a national, representative study on ageing in Ireland that collects information on health, social, and economic demographic information from folks aged 50 and over. All information was collected over the course of three waves: 2009-2011, 2012-2013, and 2014-2015.
