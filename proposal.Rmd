**Group Members:**

* Diana Ballesteros Gonzalez (uni: deg2163) 
* Chris Crowe (uni: clc2229) 
* Tanvi Jain (uni: tj2383)

**Tentative project title:** 

* Analysis of a Longitudinal Study on Aging Conducted in Ireland 

**The motivation for this project:**

* This project aims to look at the effect of sociodemographic indicators on mental health among a cohort of Irish residents aged 50+ yrs.

**The anticipated data sources:**

* The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) Waves 1, 2, and 3
* https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/726

**The intended final products:** 

* Descriptive statistics in the form of tables and plots that provide information on our project objective
* Final products include: report and webpage with screencast

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**

* ICD-10 code distribution for Wave 2 and 3 (potentially use shiny)
* Will look at key indicators such as: retired status, marital status (CS006), education (DM001), weight in kg (WEIGHT), mini mental state examination(COGMMSE_HA), BMI(FRBMI), , total financial assets(INCASSassets5, quintiles),  and number of close relatives or friends (SOCsocnet), social status ()

All: 
* physical activity(IPAQexercise3, low/moderate/high)
* age(AGE)
* employment status(employ in Waves 2&3 and WE001 in Wave 1)

Wave 1: 

* sex(SEX)
* income (INCASSETSweklyHHdisy)

Wave 3: 
* number of close relatives or friends (SOCsocnet)


* As you get older whether, feelings of loneliness (MHucla_lonliness) is due to age (AGE) controlling for marital status (CS006) and group participation 
* Physical activity levels (IPAQexercise3, low/moderate/high) changes over time 
* Comparing them to the outcome of interest: quality of life (MHcasp19_total) 
* Coding challenges: combining data from multiple waves with different variable names 

**The planned timeline:**

* Nov 12th-16th: Project review meeting 
* Week of Nov 19th: Meet up to work on the report and website  
* Week of Nov 26th: Make any last edits on the report and website and begin screencast 
* December 3rd: Add screencast to website and complete final edits 
* Dec 6th: Report, webcast, and web page due
