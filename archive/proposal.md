**The intended final products:**

-   Descriptive statistics in the form of tables and plots that provide information on our project objective
-   Final products include: report and webpage with screencast

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**

Planned Analyses / Visualizations:

-   ICD-10: bar graph of proportions of each ICD-10 code to determine which ICD-10 diagnosis accounts for the greatest burden of disease in our population. We can potentially facet by sex to see if the burden is different for males and females.
-   Loneliness: spaghetti plot of loneliness over time for males who were widowed at baseline.
-   Physical & Mental/Emotional Health: hexagonal heatmap of self-rated physical health vs. mental/emotional health among all individuals in Wave 3.
-   Quality of Life: density plots of the distribution of total scores on the CASP-19 by age group in Wave 2.

Coding challenges:

-   Combining data from multiple waves with different variable names

**The planned timeline:**

-   Nov 12th-16th: Project review meeting
-   Week of Nov 19th: Meet up to work on the report and website
-   Week of Nov 26th: Make any last edits on the report and website and begin screencast
-   December 3rd: Add screencast to website and complete final edits
-   Dec 6th: Report, webcast, and web page due
